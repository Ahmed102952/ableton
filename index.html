					<p>
						Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first

						rewarding.

						We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The
						driving force behind Ableton is our passion for what we

				</div>
				<article class="container">
					<h4>
						We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries
						divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our
						offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.
					</h4>
					<p>
						Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and
						many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from a
						wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds.
						Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of
						us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the
						shared belief that each of us has the skills and
						knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to
						shape the future of music culture.

					<h4>
						We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding
						instruments. We only work on a few products and we
						strive to make them great.
					</h4>
					<p>
						Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try
						to give our people what they need to work their magic
						and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results
						comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and
						thus able to explore problems from a wider set of
						perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but
						opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

					<h4>
						We’re passionate about what we do, but we’re equally
						passionate about improving who we are.
					</h4>
					<p>
						We work hard to foster an environment where people can
						grow both personally and professionally, and we strive
						to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and
						with each other.
					</p>
					<p>
						Alongside an internal training program, employees are
						actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and
						skills, and coached on applying these in their daily
						work. In addition, staff-organized development and music
						salons are a chance to discuss new technologies,
						production techniques and best practices.

						If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with
						relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with
						free German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany
						means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for
						you and your family, as well as generous maternity and
						paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not
						all work; we have several company and team outings
						throughout the year as well as a variety of fun,
						informal small-group activities.
